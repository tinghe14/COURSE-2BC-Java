**Block A**
```diff
+1. Fundamental programming concepts and constructs in the Java language 
```
* erros: syntax error and logic error (catached by complier or not)
```diff
+2. Java data types and their operations, selected APT usage, and program development in jGRASP
```
* data types:
  * numeric data type:
    * integer 
      * byte myVar: 8 bits
      * short myVar: 16 bits
      * int myVar: 32 bits
      * long myVar: 64 bits
    * floating point
      * float myVar: 32 bits
      * double myVar: 64 bits
    * binary: a processor stores a number using base 2
    * operations: 
      * Math class: sqrt(x), pow(x,y),abs(x)
      * type conversions: (int),(double)
    * errors:
      * store a variable greater than 2 billion into an int variable
  * non-numeric data type:
  * constant variables:
